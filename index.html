<h2>Eid literally means a “festival” or “feast” in Arabic. There are two major eids in the Islamic calendar per year – Eid al-Fitr earlier in the year and Eid al-Adha later.
    Eid al-Fitr is a three-day-long festival and is known as the “Lesser” or “Smaller Eid” when compared to Eid al-Adha, which is four-days-long and is known as the “Greater Eid.”</h2>

<h2>Christmas is the most pious festival of Christians, but it is celebrated across the world now-a-days irrespective of caste and class. It is celebrated as the birthday of the Lord Jesus Christ, who taught everyone to live a virtuous life.  Though it is true that no human being is perfect and people tend to make mistakes almost every moment which causes misunderstanding and disharmony amongst people; but Jesus taught people to follow the path of forgiveness. He assured that whosoever seeks him shall find him. People who follow Christianity follow the path of Jesus Christ and celebrate Christmas festival with great zeal and enthusiasm.
